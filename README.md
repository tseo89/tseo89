- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak 4 languages lived in 3 different countries, and visited 11 countries throughout 2 continents. What a journey 🤩 
- 📈 Why data: 
I like data because it's like a diet and exercise. Regardless of who you are, if you want to change your physique, you have to be diligent (after all, we are bound by the laws of physics and the rules of biology). Much like diet, you have to be diligent about collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting the data in order to make use of it!
