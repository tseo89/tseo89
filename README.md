Hi, I'm Tina!

Nice to e-meet you! Thank you for visiting my page. 

I'm a seasoned Data Analytics and Project/Program Management professional. My skills include business analytics, data visualization, project/program management, end-end process development/improvement, SQL, Python, and ML. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to further my technical skills in Python, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistics, Software Development Tools, Machine Learning, and more! 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with more ways to write an efficient Python code and data visualization. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her 👩‍💻
- 📫 You can reach out to me via email: tseo89@gmail.com or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinaseo/)
You can also view my current resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gf80SyseQxoUWX_400nbMyNUHwte9qho4ndss47v1zk/edit). 

- ⚡ Fun fact: I speak 4 languages lived in 3 different countries, and visited 11 countries throughout 2 continents. What a journey 🤩 
- 📈 Why data: 
I like data because it's like a diet and exercise. Regardless of who you are, if you want to change your physique, you have to be diligent (after all, we are bound by the laws of physics and the rules of biology). Much like diet, you have to be diligent about collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting the data in order to make use of it!
